FHA loans are a popular choice for first-time homebuyers and those with less-than-perfect credit. In 2025, the eligibility requirements remain accessible while ensuring responsible lending practices.

## Credit Score Requirements

The minimum credit score for an FHA loan is 500, but there's a catch. If your score falls between 500-579, you'll need to put down at least 10%. With a score of 580 or higher, you can qualify for the minimum 3.5% down payment.

## Debt-to-Income Ratio

Your DTI ratio compares your monthly debt payments to your gross monthly income. FHA guidelines typically require a DTI of 43% or less, though some lenders may accept higher ratios with compensating factors.

## Down Payment

One of the biggest advantages of FHA loans is the low down payment requirement. With a credit score of 580+, you can put down as little as 3.5% of the purchase price.

## Employment History

Lenders want to see stable employment, typically at least two years in the same field. Gaps in employment may need to be explained.

## Property Requirements

The home must be your primary residence and meet FHA property standards. An FHA-approved appraiser will evaluate the property to ensure it meets these requirements.
