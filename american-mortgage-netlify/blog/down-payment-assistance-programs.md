Down payment assistance (DPA) programs can help make homeownership more accessible by reducing the amount of cash you need upfront. Here's what you need to know about these valuable programs.

## What is Down Payment Assistance?

DPA programs provide funds to help cover your down payment and/or closing costs. These programs are offered by state and local governments, nonprofits, and some lenders.

## Types of DPA Programs

**Grants:** Free money that doesn't need to be repaid. These are often income-restricted.

**Forgivable Loans:** Second mortgages that are forgiven after you live in the home for a certain period (usually 5-10 years).

**Deferred Loans:** Second mortgages with no monthly payments, due when you sell, refinance, or pay off your first mortgage.

**Low-Interest Loans:** Second mortgages with below-market interest rates and affordable monthly payments.

## Who Qualifies?

Eligibility varies by program but typically includes:
- Income limits (often 80-120% of area median income)
- Credit score minimums
- First-time homebuyer status (though some programs don't require this)
- Homebuyer education course completion
- Property location requirements

## How to Apply

Work with a lender experienced in DPA programs. At American Mortgage, we'll help you identify programs you qualify for and guide you through the application process.
