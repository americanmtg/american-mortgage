Choosing between an FHA and conventional loan depends on your financial situation, credit score, and long-term goals. Let's break down the key differences.

## Down Payment

FHA loans require as little as 3.5% down with a 580+ credit score. Conventional loans can go as low as 3% down, but typically require better credit to qualify for these low down payment options.

## Credit Requirements

FHA loans are more forgiving of lower credit scores, accepting borrowers with scores as low as 500 (with 10% down). Conventional loans typically require a minimum score of 620, with better rates available for scores of 740+.

## Mortgage Insurance

FHA loans require both upfront and annual mortgage insurance premiums (MIP) for the life of the loan if you put less than 10% down. Conventional loans require private mortgage insurance (PMI) only until you reach 20% equity.

## Loan Limits

Both loan types have limits that vary by location. In 2025, FHA limits range from $498,257 to $1,149,825 in high-cost areas. Conventional conforming loan limits are $766,550, or up to $1,149,825 in high-cost areas.

## Which Should You Choose?

Choose FHA if you have a lower credit score, limited savings for a down payment, or higher debt levels. Choose conventional if you have good credit, can put 20% down (to avoid PMI), or want more flexibility in property types.
